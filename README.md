# Pagination Gmail Style
I have always been troubled in creating a proper pagination action. Finally got it right. I believe my code would be of use to someone who is experiencing the same.

# Getting Started
1. Start a local server (can use either docker, XAMPP or Apache).
2. Copy the src folder within the server localhost directory.
3. Change the Database connection details as per your requirements within src/php/connection.php
3. To obtain the sample database and its entries, run http://localhost/php/createDB.php
3. Run http://localhost on the browser to check the pagination in action.
